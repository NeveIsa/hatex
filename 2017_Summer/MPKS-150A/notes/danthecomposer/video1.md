Be a purposeful pianist.

Set short term long term goals! :-)
Learning to lay a brick as best it possibly can be laid, so that in the future wall is purposeful.

Major Scale:
- C is just before the two black notes
- Note of C has all white keys
- There are 12 notes between the octave, because there are 12 keys: 13th is the octave
- Flat goes down(left), Sharp goes up(right)
- 7 notes in major scale
