- [Leverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(statistics)): measure of how much
an independent variable deviates from its mean. Higher the leverage, higher the chance of 
it being *influential*. In lay man's language, if I were to shift the $i^{th}$ data point
left or right the best fit curve would(probably) shift up or down too proportionately and this
is the measure of leverage

- [Outlier]: Dependent variable having unusual value
- [Influence]: Outlierness x Leverage . An inflential point
  is inflential in the sense of having potential to change the regression coefficients
   if it is added or removed
