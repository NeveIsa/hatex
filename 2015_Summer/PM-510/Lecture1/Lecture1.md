## Lecture Notes

### Biostatistics
- Statistics applied to analysis of biological data(Dictionary def.)
- Precise: Collection, analysis, interpretation of data
- "Search for truth"
- Cannot be used to 'prove' a (biological)hypothesis

### Why (Bio)statistics?

- Inference about a population based on data collected
from sample
- Population too large to collect information: Use sample 
to make inference
- Biased sampling: Predictions going wrong.
- Means to summarise, characterise data: Do observations
deviate from expectation or random choice?
- Quantify deviation, compare results across studies
- Tools to estimate sampling size, how large a study should be
to detect an effect under consideration
- "Lie with statistics"



### Introduction

- Statistics: Inference about population based on data collected
from its sample: Who selected, why selected, how selected might
effect inference

- Inference applies to the population sampled. May or may not
apply to another independent population

- Sample: homogeneous/heterogenuous affects

- Random  sample: eliminates bias

- Stratified random sample: Eliminates bias
within strata(group). Eg. male v/s female graduate students(strata)
male v/s female is an imp. biological diff, so the sampling should
be random for males and females(within strata). Across strata this
might not be random
	- Randomly sample left/right handed
	- Randomly sample people with specific genotype

- Sample of Conveniennce: Possibly biased
	- Degree of closeness
	- Sample women magazines, and your readers 
	will (mostly) be women
	- Sampling from support group: Specific group
	of people(who volunteered) and hence biased
	towards cancer in some way

- _READ_: Marijuana article by Tashkin et al.
	- 32 male non-tobacco, non-drug users, experienced marijuana smokers
	- Type of sample: By Choice(walking by the clinic)
	- Sample Biased?: They were passing by clinic,
	  possibly health issue, bias due to social stigma,
	  bias for free pot

- _READ_: GWAS study by Randall et al.
	- Sample: By choice(non hispanic europeans)
	- Pulled together existing sample from various studies: Had entry requirement
	so specific samples, bias coming in from the existing studies,
	ancestry(self-claimed) not known

- Sampling: Precision v/s Accuracy
	- Just like target practising
	- Higher spread in bell curve: less precision
	- Centered around population mean: high accuracy
	- Need to be precise & accurate

- Design of experiment: Analysis and Design go hand in hand
	- Need to maximise statistical power
	- Type of designs:
		- Case-Control:
		- Completely randomized: 10 subjects EACH assigned a treatement randomly
		- Randomized block: All treatement to all subjects in a random order
		- Cross-over: 
			#TODO: Cross-over v/s randomized block?
		- Observational: 
  
- _Blocked Randomization_: Equal numbers of subject for each treatment


- _Stratified Randomization_: Ensure within strata balance

- Random number generator for randomisation

- How not to do randomisation:
	- Insulin in peripheral v/s portal vein
	- Dose in periphary = $\frac{1}{2}$ Dose in portal
	- Each animal given both doses on randomisation schedule



## Classification of Data

- Categorical: Mutually excluve categories:
	- Nominal: No natural order(e.g. male .feam
	- Ordinal: Some kind of ordering(e.g. # of pregnancy, paritty, maturation/education level)

- Discrete: Countable, ordered whole numbers 
	- Number of crimes etc

- Continuous: Ordered, can take any value

- Continuous data can be categorised(e.g. Age categories)

- Discrete data can be analyse as coninuous(Treat 0,1,2 category
as on continuousa


### Statistical Inference:

- Making an assertion about the population parameter on basis of a
sample statistic

- Parameter: characteristic of a variable in the population
- Statistic: An estimate of sample paramter, based on sample


## Measures of central tendency:

- "Location of 'middle' of data": Mean, median, mode

- Outlier: Problematic values(not those that don't fit the hypothesis)
