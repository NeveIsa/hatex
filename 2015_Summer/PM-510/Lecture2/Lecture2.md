## Misc Notes
- Lab for next 2 weeks at 1PM

## Lecture Notes
- Range = Single number = difference between the largest and smallest values
- Standard error of the mean = $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
- Standard error is a sample statistic
- Standard error of the mean, is the sampling error of the sample-mean statistics
You essentially use it as a measure of the deviance of the sample mean from the
true population mean

### Box Plot

- Box represents first and third quantile of the data
- A horizontal line inside the box marks the second quantile

## Quantiles and Quartiles
- Quartiles are numbers dividing the dataset into 4-equal sized datasets
- Quartile is a type of quantile.
- Quantile = Values taken at regular intervals from the inverse of a CDF. A q-quantile involves
dividing data into q-equal sized datasets.
- Only 1 2-quantile = median
- 3-quantiles =  tertiles
- 4-quantile= quartile
- Standardising: $X’ = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$
- More samples are good, but also need to consider cost etc

## Sampling from population
- Precision and accuracy of estimator depends on the sample size(makes sense)

## Power transformation
- $x’ = x^p$ for $x’$ to be normally distributed
- Box-Cox transform is a method to determine optimal p

## CLT

- Means of samples from normally distributed samples are themselves normal(Proved too many times)

## CI

- CI: True value of a parameter lies within certain bounds
- $\alpha$: Priobability of rejecting null hypothesis where the null hypothesis implies no difference
when the null is true, thus making a wrong decision
- $1-\alpha$: Probabilty of rejecting the nul hypothesis when the null is true.

- Cases differ when the population variance aree knwn or unknown
