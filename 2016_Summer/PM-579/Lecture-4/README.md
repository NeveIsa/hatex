Prostate cancer dataset: two co-factors knocked out

t-test: Instable because of the standard error estimation in the denominator

Smyth 2004: borrow information from genes when there are few samples but lot of genes
Emprical Bayes: Use distribution of data to gain more stable average 
Larger $N$ => gene variance gives more weight to it's own variance so doing this for 
large sample imples doing a normal t-test.

$s_i^2$ follows log-normal distrbution.
