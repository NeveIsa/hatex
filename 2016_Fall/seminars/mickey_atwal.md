- Time scales:
	- 10^0 years: evolution in individuals	
	- 10^4 : population genetics
	- 10^8: comparative genomics
- p53 stress response
    - inhibitors: mdm2, mdm4
    
- Mechanism of MDM2:
    - Homoozygous T --> Reponse to Stress
    - Homozygous G --> Reduced response

- African/American cohost
    - Same G haplotype across 
    - Hasn't ahd time to recombine, looks like natural selection
    - Evolutionar selected SNPS in pathway -- easier to find,
    - Functional SNPS -> Harder tp find

- Detecting natural selection:
    - Given distrinuton of mutations, 
    - Very little diversity around --> Low entropy
    - Want to find --> Find alleles with high frequency and low entropy

- Why selection on p53?
    - IVF clinics: Women underrepresented in the rare allele
    - p53 network --Genetic relation to fertility

- Probabilstic CNB inference
    - Statsistical mechanics based model for
