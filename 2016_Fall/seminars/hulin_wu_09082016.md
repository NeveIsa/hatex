Multiscale Systems Biology Modeling for Host Response to Influenza
Infections using Bif Data


- PRecidion medicine: important to analuze data
- Types of data:
	- Sensor based,
	- EEG
	- Omics
	- self-reported measures

- precision medince(PM) works if 
	- understand interaction b/w human body in quantitative and systematic way
	- understand pathogenosis
	- understand treatment/drug 

- PM analogous to missile launch[precision wise]

- Biology: Need integration instead of reduction


- Data Driven models for genes, proteins, 

- Linear ODEs:
	- How to determine significant edges of network
	- Curse of Dimensoonality
	
- Interaction may not be linear

- Mechanistic models: derive from biological principles? : cellular
 and immune response

- To model ODEs, simply use all proteins, then later determine coefficients to infer best paramenters
