# ESR1 mutation in Breast Cancer

- ESR1 - A TF 
- Mutations in this receptor: How breast cancer gets affected?

## ESR
- ESR1 --> Overexpressed in 70% of breast cancer
- Andrew: Changed the title?
- Estrogen binds to estrogen receptor -> binds to DNA -> regulate genes
- Estrogen produced from ovary -> binds to receptor -> conformation change happens
- Binding can happen via binding co activators
- Whenzheng: Is their over expression in other cancers as well?
    - Amal: Not sure, but generally over expressed
- Liz: How does over expression work?
    - Amal: Most likey reason -> copy number variation
- Andrew: Only CNVs?
    - Amal: Don't know the exact mechanism
    - Survival of cancer cell requires estrogen

## Common Treatment
- Method 1: Stop production of estrogen -- Aromatase inhibitor
- Method 2: use drugs to prevent Estrogen binding to receptor
    - Competitively binds to the ER
- Method 2: Does not work perfectly -> Patients develop endocrine resistance (Endocrine = Hormone treatment)
- Andrew: How does the mechanism work independent of Estrogen?
    - Amal: Some other molecules are able to bind to the receptor
    - Andrew: its posiisble to have mutation 
    - Amal: mutations in LBD -> change in DBD
    - Liz: Dimerization structures improves the stability so that could be one possible mechanism

- ESR1  mutations rare or nonexistent in primary tumor
- Significantl enriched in metastatisc, Endocrine therapy resitant


- Sarat et al. 2016 analyzed cell free DNA from 541 MBC patients, 30% had ER mutation

## Characeteristics

- Ligand binding domain --> 
- Veronica: Does it confer charge difference 


## Questions

- Bindign site difference?
- Whethere there are other cofactors present?
- Does it result in DE genes?

- Andrew: What is the logical order of questions? Lots of people study in ER mutations.
In our context we are interested in studying binding related chagnes
    - Amal: Priority: Binding site differences > Cofactor > 
- If less binding site difference: other factors include change in binding energy --> Not necessarily cofactors

- Meng: Already know the motif?


- Use CTCs originate from primary tumor --> CTCs found 
- Amal: mutations in LBD -> change in DBD

- ChIP Seq for finding binding sites

- Expericmental design: Crx68 cell lines = CTC; 
- Mutation happens in C-terminal antibody

- Ben: transfect the mutant how do you know it is homozygous?
- Liz: Er -ve does not have cancer?
    - Different pathway may allow basisal expression
- Jenny: Transfection is to create a homozygous mutant

- Mutatnt and wildtype bind together :
- Andrew: Heatmap  seems to be mixing two kinds of proteins?

- Absence of estrogen => WT ER binds to chromatoon
- Without ligand we should see 1000 peaks -> No peaks

- Meng: In abs of ER WT bonds to chromatin? Shouldn't it be inactivated

- Saket: Distances for heatmap? Euclidean? Manhattan?
