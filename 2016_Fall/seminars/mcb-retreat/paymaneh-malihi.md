## Morphological and Genomic characterization of CTC in tratment naive early stage prostate cancer

- High definition single cell analysis
- T.R Ashworth. 1869 - first CTC; made observation abt metastatis

## Challenges in detcting  CTCs
- Sensistivity : Low incidence rate
- Specificity: Looking for cells in pool of white bollod cells


- High definition singlce cell analysis
- "No cell left behind"
- Whole blood -> Erthycyte lysis -> CTC -> Store -> Thaw and process -> Stain & Scan -> Technical analusis

- All WBC have CD45(green staining)
- DAPI - nuclei blue
- CK (Epitherlia) in red


- look at copy number profiles in single cells or targeted proteomics
- Other clinical sample types: monolayer of cells(tumor touch); Bone marow aspirate 

## CTC's facebook

- Clinical infromation
- cf DNA profile -> Flat profile == no modifications
- Look for cell free DNA
- Imaging Cytometry - > look for diferent proteins
