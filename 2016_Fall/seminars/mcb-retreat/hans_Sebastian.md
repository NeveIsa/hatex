## Role of ribsome modulation factor in the long-term survival of E.ccol
- Focus on stationar phase: where total rna conc decreases
- 85% of RNA is rRNA folded within ribisolmes
- Total rRNA conce is equal to total number of ribosomes in the celll
- Stationar phase cells, nutrients are limited and 70S ribiosomes become sources of nutirents

- 100S ribsome essentual for survival in stationary phase
- Lack of 100S ribosome --> Short lived advantage

- When more nutrient -> 100S spit into two 70S?
- 100S -> confer protection against degradation in starved cells
