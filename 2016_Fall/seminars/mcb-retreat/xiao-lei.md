## Missense mutation in lymphoma patient
- Lymphonma: most common blood cancer
- Origin: WBC, B-cell and T-cell affected
- MEF2 - Myocyte Ennhancer Factor 2 
	- Dimerizes and binds to dna
	- require cofactor ca be co-repressor or co-activator
- D83V mutation most frequent mutation
- MEF2B mutation enhances transcription of oncogene BCL6


Problem:
- Current MEF2B/DNA structure does not explain the most frequent D83V mutation role in DLBCL
- MD studies show the D83V mutation allows MEF2B to bindi promiscuosly to wider variet of gene promoters


Hypothesis
- C-terminal helix flippwed up does not allow CAbin1 to bind( which is a repressor) thus driving expression

Question:
- Sickel cell anemica involves protein aggregation? It probably does not happen here
