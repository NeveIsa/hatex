TF bnding

- Tissue specific - combinatorial
- TF binding -> leads to recruitment of Pol II
- Higher Poll II does does not mean transcription --> Poll II pausing
- Poll II recruitment is not the only rate limitng step
- Paused POll II is rate limiting. 

- Pausing prepares for rapid activation
- Does Pol II also help new POll II initiation?

- Does degree of pausing correlate with distint sequence motif?
- No paused Pol II in early embryos -> TATA box
-
- Pol II pausing - Nascent RNA-seq, ChIP-seq
- ChIP-nexus data to distinguis between Pol II initiation and pausing
- 

- ChIP- nexus -> Increased ChIP resolution by exonuclease digestion
-  Protein is the mid point beween the positive and negative strands
- Similar to iCLIP for adapter ligation

- Goal: map the PIC invivo


## Questions
- Naive: Same antibody for all basal TFs?
- How do you ensure if it is the same Poll II that did not fall off?



- Calculate the half life of paused poll II for each gene and examine initiation
	- Treat with Triptolite
	- Puased polymerase will elongate or fall off
	- All pol II will come from that is either paused
- Half lives based on an exponential decay models

- TATA promoters can be non-paused
- Paused pol II inhibits new initiation
- Initiating and paused poll II are mutually exclusive

## How does the new model make sense?
- Transcription operates in bursts
- Single rate limiting step -> inactive times are exponential
- So mutiple rate limiting steps exist
- Mutating tATA -> higher refractory period

- Binding correlates with open chromatin
- Activators are present at repressed cnhancers

- Enhancer activation starts with repression
