## Hydrogen Bond
Hydrogen bonds are weak but vital. Arises from the slight positive
chage on H atom with slight negative adjacent atom

- Hold H20 together
- B/w DNA strands
- Protein shape

## Water

Required for
- digestion
- excretion
- respiration
- circulation

### Six properties
- Liquid at room temperature
- Good polar solvent
    - H+ O-
    - Hydrophilic subtrances are easily dissolved(due to polarity)
    - Hydrophobic substances are not soluble. E.g fats and oils

- Cohesive(molecules stay together) and adhesive(sticks to membraines)
    - Blood = 92%water => sticks to sides of blood vessels to fill them completely
- High heat of vaporization
    - 540 kcal for 1kg

- Ice floats
    - H bonds cease to break and so ice forms

## H ion concentration affects properties

- H2O = H+, OH- 
- H+ concentraion increases  => acidity increases
- OH- concentraion increase => basicity increases

- pH scale [0,14] [acidic, basic]
- logarithmic scale one unit represents 10 fold change in concentration of H+/OH-

 - Acidity affects rate of most of reactions in the body
 - Blood pH must stay between 7.4 and 7.5
 - Breath too slowly => CO2 lvels up => acidic


# Categories of organic chemicals

- Carbohydrates
- Lipids
- Proteins
- Nucleic Acids

## Carbohydrates
- Energy source for body
- C:H:O :: 1:2:1
- Many carbohydrates are sugars/saccahrides 
    - Monosaccharides -> 1 ring of 6 carbons, 12 H, 6O --> Glucose, Fructose(simple sugars)
    - Disaccharides -> 2 monosacharrides linked together --> sucrose and lcatose 
    - Oliogsaccharides -> Few monosacharrides in chain --> Raffinose
    - Polysaccharides -> many monosacharrides  --> Glycogen (broken down in animal tissue sucha as muscle and liver), 
        cellulose in plants

- Dehydration reaction links together monosaccharides
- Sucrose = Glucose + Fructose
- Ribose + Deoxyribose

## Lipids

- Not soluble in water
- Oils, wax, fats => long chain carbon containing
- C,H,O but not 1:2:1 ratio
- fewer oxygen than Carbohydrates
- Dehydration reaction produces triglyides


- Glycerol + satuated fatty acids  -> (dehydration) -> Triglycerides
- Phospholipids -> Lipids with phosphate group; polar head, non polar tails
- Steroids -> Lipids with common four ring structure
-
