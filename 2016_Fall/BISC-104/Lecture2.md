Nucleus = Protons + Neutrons

Neutron => Neutral

Positron => Positive charges

Electron => Negative charged

Isotopes => Same number of protons, different number of neutrons

Atomic mass => Number of protons + neutrons
Atomic number => Number of protons

Identififier of an element is the proton, so the identity is established by the number of protons

- Istotopes are unstable => break apart releasing energy, energy released maybe harmful/useful

Example of isotope => Radioactive iodine taken up by thyroid gland to help in imaging

4 most abundant elements => C,H,O,N (All neutral) . These elements have shells are not full (<(2n^2)) so they are reactive

O -> 8,16  -> 65%
C- 6,12 -> 18% 
N -< 7, 14 -> 3%
H - 1,1 -> 10%
Ca -> 20,40.1 -> 2%
P -> 15,31 -> 1
K -> 19,39.1 -< 0.3
S -> 16, 32.1 -> 0.2
Cl > 17, 35.5 -> 0.1
Mg -> 12, 24.3 -> Trace
Fe -< 26, 66.8 -> Trace

IF valence shell is not full -> element is reactive

Atoms with 1-3 electons in valence shell tends to lose electron forming a positive ion
Atoms with 5-8 electrons tends to gain electrons to form negative ion

Molecule => Unit formed from two or more atoms. H bond pairs with H to form H2.
Compound => Molecule with unlike atoms

Chemical properties of compound have little or nothing to do with properties of the atom that make it up

Three types of bonds:
1. Covalend => Strongest => Formed by sharing of electrons such that outermost valence shell is full
2. Ionic => Moderate => One atom gains, other loses electron
3. Hydrogen => Weak  => Formed because of electronegative difference

O2 forms double bond by sharing of electorns

one bond = one pair of electrons

Ionic bonds -> Formed by donating and gaining of electrons between two atoms 

QUESTION people ask: Neutralilty vs stability

Na+ Cl- => Na donates gaining positive charge and Cl accpets one electron -> negative charged

Covalent bons can be polar or non=polar . POlar or non=polar bonds arise because of the way atoms are shared.
If electrons are shared unequally,  they are polar elese nnon-polar
