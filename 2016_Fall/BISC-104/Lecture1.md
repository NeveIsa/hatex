Life -> Sense env, respond to stimuli, reproduce, alter env, adapt to env --> So CAN FIRE 
--> So to be more precise should have DNA/RNA + maintain homeostasis (unchaing environemnt inside)

Homeostasis maintained by negative feedback loop => [Receptor --> Control Center --> Effector] 
Example: Temeprature maintainance in body: Effectors are sweat glands which lead to increase secretion, dilation of blood vessels
receptors on body skin and hypothalamus

Organization of life: Chemical -> Cellular -> Tissue -> Organ -> Organ system

Body organization: Integumentary system (protects from injury, receives sensory  input) -> skeletal system -> muscular system
-> Nervous system -> Endocrine (hormones) -> Digestive -> Circulatory -> Lymphatic -> Respiratory  

Taxonomy-> Classification into groups with similar charcteristics -> 3 domains: Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, Eukarya
6 kingdoms -> Archaebacteria, Eubacteria, protista, fungi, plantae, animal

Humans: Order-> Primates. Family->Hominidae. Class-> Mammalia
