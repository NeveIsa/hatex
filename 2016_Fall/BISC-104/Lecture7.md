Tissue -> Cells of similar type grouped to perform similar function together
- Connective tissue composed of cells suspended in non-cullar matrix -> can be solid, gerl-like or liquid
- Two types of fibres:
  - Collagen for strength
  - Elastin for flexibility, stretch and recoil
- Connective tissue classification:
  - Soft connective tissue(loose, dense, elastic)
  - Specialized connective tissue(cartilage, bone, blodo_
  
- Soft connective ttiwwe:
  - loose - no directionality
  - dense -  some directionlay
  - elastic

- Specialized  connective tissue:
  - Cartalage unique because it is avascular--> oythe types include blood
- Chondrocytes like cartilaginous cells c secrete

- 3 kinds of cartilage:
  - Trachea
  - Epiglottis
  - Knees

- Connective tissue - Blood
  - Called connective tissue because it is not solid 
  - Fluid matrix -> Plasma
  - Transport nutrients: gases, hormones, wasters
  
- Bone
  - Hard mineralized tissue 
  - Bone cell secrete substance that eventually hardens
  
- Adipose tissue
  - Provides movement and heat

- Function of muscular tissue - to contract
  - cells get shorter, genereating force and often movement
  - 3 types: skeletal, smooth, cardiac
  
- Skeletal tuss:
  - Multiple nuclei in skeletal muscle fiber
  - During development fuse together
  - Visible striations
  - Skeletal muscle -> voluntary
  
- Smooth muscle
  - No striation
  - Smooth muscle involuntary and not striated
  - Smooth muscle lines hollow organs, sich as blood vessels and digestive tract
  
- Cardiac
  - Sungle nuclei 
  - Striated
  - Connected by untercalated disc
  - Involuntary
  
- Nervous tissue
  - Detect and process stimuli
  - Dendrites - recive impulsees from other nuerons
  - Axons - transmit impuse from cell body to other cells
  - Exist in body's periphary and so part of peripheral nervous system
  - Moro nevers carry impulses that cause muscular movement

- Anatomical position
  - Proximal/distal
  - Dorsal(back)/Ventral

- Bone structure
  - Provide support
  - anchoring skeletal muscles
  - protect soft tissue and organs
  - producing blood cells ( hematopoiesis)
  - Storing and releasing minerals
  - 206 bones -- 26 in the feet
