Graph search each node has unique state ???

To break tie -> alphabetically --> Important

Tree seach -> allows to have amny nodes with same state


DFS



OPEN 	  S ->  ABC  -> EFBC -> G1
Explored  S -> A -> E ->  

SAEG1


UNiform Cost > Optimal because goal test done while popping which is the cheapest
We dont udpate the state but the node.


Have a way to look at fronteier and explored set to check if distances change

** Tree search -> can have many nodes with same state
not in Grpah search
