## Quiz-3 Answers

1. Trafectoderm cell mass -> gives rise to major parts of placenta. Fetus is not discarded during pregnancy. Not all embryos will
generate the fetus. Fetus is post implantation product.

3. siRNA has no nuclease, but an RNA homologus to a section and does RNA-RNA binding. Can also lead to attenuation of 
translation

6. CARM1 is not a tf ad it does not bind to DNA

#### "Ex Ov Omni" L Everything comes out of an egg: -- William Harvey 1651
- Parthogenesis: reproduction without fertilization
- Can this jappen in mammals?
- Aristotle: "epigenesis" -- progressive development of the organism
- "Preformation": -- Looking down the microscopes Van Leuweenhoek -- saw miniature preformed humans
- Development initiated on fertilization of eff by sperm
- Primordial germ cells lie outside in the yolk sac  in the primitive endoderm and goes to gonads (testers/ovaries)
 pre sexual differentiation. They give rise exclusively to egg or sperm. All other cell types make up soma
-

- Development of sperm happens in testes -- STart swith 46 chromosomes -> Divide with first meiotic division to give
 23X+23X and 23Y+23Y . This will each result in 4 haploid cells
- oocyte --> one of follices will get starting begire . In between goes under meoptoc division to reduce
46 XX to two 23X. But only one nucleus remains. So there is one to one mapping.


Before differnrtiation all matters is how to extract nutirent from uterus: it's all about extra embryonic memebrac

Primitive Endoderm -> Yolk sac 
Epiblast -> Pluripotent

- It is actually the environment that 
- Y chromosome has genes on it that make it essential for making sperm
- If you move an oocyty(XX) into the testes, it will not geneerat sperms. But if you insert $XY$ spermocyte into ovary, 
 it will generate aviable oocyte (containing X as Y will be chucked out)
- They have to put into primodial cell stage.

## Mitosis vs Meiosis

- Mitosis: each chromosome pair replicates -> align across mitotic spindlr -? replicated chromatids separate two poles
- Meiosis : Due to recombination events --> each cell is different
- Meiosis: If transpoases ends it could still be possible to chuck off portions affected by taransposases through recombination
- 
## Comparison of sperm and egg development
- Reduction of chromosome number by meiosis : 46 to 23
- males Make a half a trillion sperm
- Around 5 months of fetal development femake have germ cells????

Maturation of sperm:

- Centriole of cell -- enables chromosome to align during mitosis --> no mitotic spindle created
- Acrosome developmed from Golgi apparatus
- Nucleus makes the first contact with egg
- Only thing sperm introudces into the egg is its dna. So mitochondira is from mother alwasys


Oocyte -> fertilized egg
- Polar body
- Simulate progrestron.
-  Fertlser: When so sperm goes close to egg, dues to biochemical prference


Zygote:
- Sperm carries X or Y chromsome. If X is selected than the zygote carries identical information, but it is not genetically 
equivalent if the sperm was carrying Y chromosome
- How to determine if they are developmentally equivalnet? -- Remove one parental nuclei
- DIC - Differential interference contrast micrography
- Somatic cell nuclear transfer -- Insert nuclei into cell with no nuclei -- very similar to Parthogenesis
- Types:
  - Both female: gynogenones
  - Both male: androgenones
  - male-female : paternal/maternal
  - female-male: maternal/paternal
  - The last two control for the technique
- Both female nuclei = insufficient placental development
- Both male: normal placenta but embryo growth retarded
- Lookup HAIG hypothesis as to why nuclei are equivalent: Males want its progeny to be successful, his genome thus pushes placental development. In case of females she must have mated with several males she wants best embryo
- Non equivalence of parental genomes: Prader-Wili/Angelman syndrome --> Identical deletion but different phenotype based
 on which parent inherited what?
- Maternal copy: Angelman syndrome; Paternal copy: PRader-Wili
- Parental imprintin of chromsomes imposes uniparental expression of genes
- In imprinted region either o genes from the fatehr or the mother will be active. Allele will be active or inactive
 depending on parent context. If the deletion is on the parent from which it should have effect --> It should have a different phenotype


## Imprinting and DNA methylation

- Methylated DNA -- leads to compaction of chromatin and repression of transcription
- methylation -- DNMT1, DNMT3A, 3B -> pits methyl group onto cytosine (5mC) 
- demethylation -- TET1,2,3 --> change methyl to hydroyx methyl cutosine (5hmC) whih is recognzed by dna repair mechansism
- removing DNMT1 which helps in maintaing methylation post replication -- no methylation
- 70% promoters have CpG islands
- Methylation key aspect of regulating the genome
- Necessary to remove imprint for it to be approriate for the next generation


-- Massive demethylation: Wave 1 early germline -- fetail imrpint, remove imprints -- new imprints established premeiosis at fetail stages
-- Wave2 early embryo -- estblishes toptpotency
-- In wave2 male is wiped out almost instaneoulsy
-- In females as you divide hemimethylase is lost so methylation decreases
-- Imprinting servives Wave 2
-- Methylation is mechanism of imprinting 
-- Resetting in wave 2 is required because in wave 1 all genes were acting differently till wave 1 [spermatogonia vs oocytes]
-- Silencing a bunch of genes is required that are not required for Zygote, but are required for blastocytes
-- In Zygote the genes that are repressed have been imprinted through methylation [ parent of origin methylation]
-- All spems will have smae methylation level before they form zygote

-- 1st cell cleavege leads to massive drop in methylation levels
-- methylation increase during cell differntiation


## Blastomeres toptipotent?

- Two blastomrere: separate and they give a new mouse --> Both tottipotent
- 4 blastomere --> Might not be sufficient for one blastomere to generate enough cells 


- Mice: chimeric 
- Test potentcy with chimera: 4 cell conor -> aggregate into 8 cell embryo -->  likely totipotent


-- Planes of cleacvage: Two possible plans: both outer. one outer _ one inner -> Pne will remain pkluripotent. Two ways of inner 

-- Outside cells --> trophectoderm

-- Cdx2 required for pluripotent 
-- One explaniation of epiblast vs trophectoderm is via the hippo pathway -- apical polarity onl exists in outside cells
-- inner cells  maintina pluripotency through hippo pathway supressing Cdx2
-- Apical polarity has access to memebrance while non apical cells are homogenous throughtout

-- Wave 1 cycle of asymmeteric produce Fgf4 (8-16 cycle) -- produce ligand
-- Wave 2 asymmetric    produces Fgr2                     (16-32 cycle)   -- already like traphectodrom -> can respond to Fgf4. Ther's no recept on Wave 1 cells -> Wave2 cells provide the receptor, Wave1 produced the ligand fgf4

- NANOG and GATA6 have opposite actions
- Eth pluripotency and differentiation genes are overlapping, but the programming hapens throughm methylation cuycles.
