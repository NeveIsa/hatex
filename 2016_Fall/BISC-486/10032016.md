## Gastrulation to vertrebrae

- ventral scells give rice to sclerotome which forms the skeletal system of vertrebrae
- Signals come from notochord
- Sclerotome -> divide and migrate and surrond neural tube and then they start to differentuate -> first form cartillage
- notchord --> intervertebral disc

- How do you mkae different vertevrae?
  - There are 7 cervical different from 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral
  
- Vertebrae
  - Repeating patten of same shape, relatize size
  
  - Fly mutatnts for segmental patterning
  - antennapedia -- thoracic
  - Order of genes --> accodring to body plan
  - Homoedomain -> Hox genes have can only be identifyed in conjunction with metazoan evolution
  - amphioxus - no vertrebral column
  
  -- IF H10 is removed H10 Lumbar will take over the thoracic activity
  
  -- If developmental process is aprocess where segmentation is part, then Hox genes 
 - Cranial (Anterior) , Claudal(posterior) 
 - cKIT -- Heterozygous --> lack of pigmentation
 - Snail important for breaking down epitherlial cells
 
 - Epithelia to mesanchymal
 - Melanoma will generally involve Snail
 
 - Parasymphathetic (acetylcholine, rest or digest) -- slows heart
 - Sympathetic (noradreanline, fight or flight) -> accelerate heart
 
 
 - Tubular systems - Lunks, Kidney, Salivary glands
 -  Six 2 cnodes TF essential for nephron progenitrs
    
 - Kidney branching? What regulates?
 - Stem cell - doesnt get used up
 - Progenitors - get used up
