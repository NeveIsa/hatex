- retrovirus induced -> enters into host cell
  - specific propoerties: 
    - reverse transcribes RNA into DNA
    - integrates into the host cell

- probelms with current HIV treatment
  - evolution : viral load decreases and then shoots up after 6-8 years
  
- How to cure?
  - Approach1: Clear out the latent virual load dormant between years 2-8
  - Approach2: Functional cure => remove the function
  
- Approach1:
    - Start therapy earlier
    - Shock and Kill: Kill all cells that have HIV
    - Lock and block: 
    - Excise HIV

- Approach2:
  - Measure the cloncal multplicity based on sites of integration
    - How much should the pool be reduced?
    
    - Model:
      - Stochastic model for propogation of latent virus cells
      - Large reduction in latent reservoir load results in viral rebound
      - Multi log reduction in the viral pool
