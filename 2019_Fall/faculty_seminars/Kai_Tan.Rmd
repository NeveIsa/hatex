- Transcriptional enhancers => tissue specific


Challenges in finding non-coding variants:

- Tissue specific regulatory DNA sequences?
- complexity of human genome (e.g.: most highest -log10 pvalue SNP
is not necessarily the most significant)


Operation of methods:

- Genetic variants ranked with a catalogue of candidate risk variants
- Do not consider the expression of the downstream loci


ARVIN:

- Combine sequence feature with disease relevant regulatory network
- SNP in enhancer is annotated by epignomic feature => how to determine target?

- Combine Chip-Seq, with existing SNPs (GWAS) and intersect with existing 
dise 

- SNPs in intron (common)
- T1D finding: SNP that acts a blocker


# Somatic mutation
- No method to perfrom rare variants across contexts

# TF regulon

- Most TF regulons dirupted are not from TF coding mutations
- level of TF regulon perturbnation correlates with patient progrnosis
