- Major Histocompativbility complex
- Class and Class 2 alleles => Located on Chromosome 6's short arm in the HLA region
- Sequence in the regions determines the specificity of the peptide
- Hypothesis: Set of HLA alleles that an individual carries determines what
cancer mutations will go undetected (?)

-Existing Tool:
	- Single allele + polypeitde => Get affinity of peptide given that allele
- Whay another tool?
	- Allow for multiple alleles 
	
- Mutations conferring evolutionary advantage and letting it survive the immune response
- Too difficult to follow....


- Immunosurvelience delays cancer onset
- Mutations are more liekly to be observed in tumor if
are poorly presented.


- MHC-II contributing to immunselecttion or immune editing?
- Lesser in patient variation in MHC II presentation
