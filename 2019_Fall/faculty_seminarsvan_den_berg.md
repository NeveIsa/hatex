- HiC-  useful for probling chromatin structure
- HiC
	- Crosslink DNA
	- Cut with restriction enzyme
	- Full ends and mark with biotin
	- Loage , purify and shear DNA-pull down biotin
	- Ue heatmap to avisualize the contacts
	
-  Loop extrusion model
	- Wing shaped proteins (SMC complexes)
	- CTCF eg. prevents loop formatiom =  eneeds to be bound to prevent extrustion
- TADs disappear when CTCF is removed

- How is transcription affected because of chromatin structure shaped by cohesin?
	- Transcription changes ocohesin positioning

- Cohesin relocalozation: doesn't make contacts outside genes
- Transcription is barrier to loop extrusion
- MEssage: transcription determines genome structure?
- Cohesin accumulates at RNAPol pause sites (Cohesin also pauses)


- Moving barrier model
- Similate initation, elongation and termination of Poll II
- Poll density profiles also recapitulate cohensin density profiles 


Conlusion
- Genes reshape chromatin by interacting with cohesin
- CTCF and transcription both influence cohesin accumulation

- Can cohesin and Poll II be responsible for brining TFs together?
