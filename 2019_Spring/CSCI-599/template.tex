%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%    
   For a subset of the colloquia each student attends, a short (1-2
   pages, single spaced, typed) reaction paper will be submitted in 
   which the students will critically engage with the presented 
   material. It is important to note, the reaction paper should not be a 
   summary – abstracts of each colloquium are published on our website
   prior to the event - but rather a thoughtful, well-reasoned attempt to
   assess those aspects of the presentation that the student finds most 
   compelling. Possible approaches may include, but are not limited to
   the following:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item  Discuss the significance of the research presented. What are 
    the practical applications or theoretical possibilities of the 
    findings?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item Explain and evaluate the presenter’s research methodology. 
    Suggest possible ways that other methods might further confirm or 
    challenge the findings, or may take the research in a new direction.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item Discuss how the research presented aligns with or complements 
    your own research/academic interests.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%    

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item Discuss new areas of inquiry you feel might spring directly 
    from, or be inspired by, this work.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item Propose a research project of your own that builds on, or is
    related to, these findings.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item Propose a research project, though unrelated in subject, 
    nevertheless incorporates some aspect, approach, or technique of the presentation.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item Evaluate the talk from a pedagogical/presentational 
    perspective. Were the concepts clearly articulated? Was the talk well-organized? Did the speaker effectively communicate his/her ideas
    to the intended audience? What methods of presentation were used to 
    engage the audience? Explicitly recognize and state effective, and not-so-effective, tools for communicating ideas to an audience of 
    your academic peers.
