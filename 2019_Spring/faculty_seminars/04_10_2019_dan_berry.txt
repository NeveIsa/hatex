Models for dynamics: 
- Models if implied synamics

Self regulation: 
	Executive function: inhibotry control, working memory, set shifting
	Effortful control: Impulse control, emotion regulation and attetion incontext
	
  Parent Child Interactions: Sensitivty and co-regulation
  School: chaso: instability, unpredictability and disorganization
  Teacher and Teacher process
  Stress Physiology
  
 - Gottileb's probabilistic epigenesis: bidirectional influences
	- But things are not linear
	- There is lot of interaction 
	
 - Waddignton's 1957 epigenetic landscape:
	Drawn towards active state

- Bronfenberure's 1979 ecological model

- How to think of these dynamic processes?
	1. Explictly model relations between the componenet parts of a broader 
	temporal system
		- Measure the unfolding within an individual over time
	
		- Specifiy a statistical model 
		that includes parameters that explicitly adrress:
		a) within sustem processes
		b) beteeen systematc
		
		Example: longitudianl data
		- Auto regressive cross-lagged panel model
		- Uniterprtable parameter
	
		Problem: Mother spanking a child -> child's aggression increase over time -> mother's spanking increase
		
	Marsh Mellow examplE: Give one marshamllow immediately or wait 5 minutes for 3 and variations
	20 observations  -> 4 nodes, each node feeds toon	
	
	example:  synchrony in parasympahht
	
	
	Cons of explicit model: Need an explit formualtion of the model; need plausible model
	
	
	2. Models of implit dynamics
	Does cognitive challenge chng
	
	Remove time structure of time-series? 
	Fractal xomplexitY?
