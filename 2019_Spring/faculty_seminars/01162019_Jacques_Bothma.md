Measuring transcription - Attach a stem loop at nascent RNA when the polymerase is still moving: Add 
GDP to measure how much mRNA is made.

Morphogenesis is decided in a very short time

What;s wrong with GFP for visualization dynamic transcription?
1) They decay too fast
2) THey have a longer maturation time (40 minutes) thus preventing short turnaround times


Llamatags => Short antiodies from llamas , fuse it to transcription
factor => As soon as TF is prodiced, it gets the GFP and llamatag
increase the fluoresnce


Measuring tx and translation together => Add MS2 tag in the introns, llma tag in the the CDS

- Protein birts follows the transcription bursts
