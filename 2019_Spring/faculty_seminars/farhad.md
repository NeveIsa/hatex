- Signifance of association fror trait: H0: \mu+\epsilon, H1: \mu+ X\beta+\e[si;lon

- Conserved cis-eqtl => Doagonal elemtns in the eqTL- gene matrix

- Caiusal variant: thresholding leads to too many

- High number of candidate varinats, but which are causal?

-Challenges - 1) Linkage disequilbrium 2) Multiple causal SNPS in a a locus

- Conditional method: Select the most signidiancat SNP based on p-value
- REcompute the statistical scores conditinal on selected SNP. Assu,ption:
most signidicant SNPS is not causal

- Solution: CAVIAR: 
	- DEfine $\rho$ causal set as the set that contains A:: true causal SNPs
	woth at leas trho probability
	- Incoporate LD and statistics ranking
- Posterior of a set of SNPS being causa. Start with $M$ and select $k$.
