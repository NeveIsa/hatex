GPS callers for tracking the behavorial data.

Juvenile, adult, subordinate, male, female? > Alpha male 

Finding animals: USe camera data, identify species

Numnber of surviving juveniles of Zebras is not enough for their survival
Why not enough babies? Predators

Biases in remote sensing data? Is counting through photographs unbiased?

Biased by: camera location, goal alignment,
species fatigue

Error estimate: population estimate - true population for correcting for biases

t's the cognitive load possibleWrong netweok can lead to wrong resultse 
Given data and the question for the network, what is the best configuration
for the network that gives lowest error


`
Long term affiliations: Zebras dont walk in same group all tim
Observong zebras in the field and their groups are chainging over tim
Relatively: Need to observe the "you" in context to a bigger
Social costs: Individuals are relucatant to switch affilicatopms
Individuals are mostly seen with their community because there is a cost of visiting.
Cost of switching can be higher or lower to cost of visiting

Individuals are rarely absent from their community

equivalent to a graph coloring problem

Why social? Constrained by the resouces, but that woul

Zebra have cohsesive structure because of the predators
