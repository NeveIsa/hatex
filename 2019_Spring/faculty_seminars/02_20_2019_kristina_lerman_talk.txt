# Friends are better than you: Friendship paradox and its social consequences

- Networks shap behavior
- Network with blue and yellow : identical topologies but stoll different perceptions
Paper: K schaul: Quick puzzle to tell whether you know what people are thinking


- Networks distorty local information: Example: college students overestimate peers' alcohol use
- Friendship paradox: Origins; bias in directed networks, polling; 

Friendship paradox: Your friends have more friends than you do, on average.
Generalized FP: You are frinds are more X than you are on average.

Strong FP: Most of your friends have more friends than you do.
Generalized SP: Most of your friends are more X than you are
Majority illusion: Most of your friends have a trait, even if it is rare.


- Strong friendship paradox: 90% of the nodes in a social network provided evidence of strong 
friendship paradox
- Also holds for activity, diversity and virality in a social media setting

FP and GFP are explained by sampling properties: long tailed distributions 
(which the speaker calls a hetereogenous distribution)
- The slide on PDF vs X had some serious problems: First of all
what is a hetereogenous distribution> Median is unaffected by sample size.

- First order (1k) structure: Long tailed arrises because very few nodes have high degrees


- Degree distribution of neighbors overpowers that of the nodes.
- Joint degree distribution for modeling degree assortavity
- NREla world networks have third order structure?


- Friendship paradox in directed networks?
- Followers are more popular than the main person on twitter
- Global popularity is different from local perception

- Polling: What is the right question to ask in a poll?
- Intent polling: b random votes: Will you vote for X?
- Node perceltption polling: Who will your friends vote for X?
- Follower perception polling (FPP): What fractions fo your friends will vote for X? [ b random followers]

- Network strucutre is very important: can have different affect on the perception

Open questions: Are freinds happiner than you are? Are your coauthors more prestigious than you are?
